This was a very simple and hacky PoC to show, how poor the McDonald's feedback system was designed.
It allowed generating vouchers for free drinks.

I have nothing to do with [these guys](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fiCtEg7atxs), **stop asking me**.

McDonalds (their service provider [International Service Check]) mitigated abuse of their feedback system with a CAPTCHA.
They changed their APIs multiple times.

**This code won't be of any use for you.**
